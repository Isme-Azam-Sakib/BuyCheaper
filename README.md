**Abstract:** The "Buy Cheaper" project simplifies finding the best deals on PC components by creating a centralized platform that compares prices from multiple vendors. Using web scraping and a user-friendly design, it provides real-time price updates and easy product comparisons. Built with a flexible development model andpowered by a MySQL database, the platform helps users save time, money, and make informed purchasing decisions.


**Problem Statement:** Finding the best deals on PC components is challenging due to numerous vendors and fluctuating prices, requiring time-consuming research. This project addresses the lack of a centralized platform by creating a user-friendly website that dynamically aggregates price data from popular vendors, enabling quick and efficient price comparisons.

**Features:**

Price Comparison: Users can search for PC components like CPUs, GPUs, RAM, SSDs, & more. Search results display product details, images, & prices from various vendors.

Dynamic Pricing: The project uses web scraping techniques to dynamically fetch product prices from different vendor websites. This ensures that users get up-to-date prices.

Product Comparison: As user is making a decision what to buy & where to buy from, we introduced a feature that can help a user to compare products side by side giving them a broader point of view

User-Friendly Interface: Aims on modern, intuitive & minimalistic design to convey information to users without overwhelming them with excessive information.
